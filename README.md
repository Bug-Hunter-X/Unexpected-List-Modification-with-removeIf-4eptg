This repository demonstrates a subtle but important issue when using the `removeIf` function in Kotlin's `MutableList`. The `removeIf` function modifies the list directly, causing unexpected behavior if not properly understood. The example shows how this can lead to a list being smaller than anticipated after calling `removeIf`. The solution provides an alternative approach to handle this situation safely.
